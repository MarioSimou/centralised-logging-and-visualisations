## Centralised Logs and Visualisation

### Description

This repository has been created to host the code of a post that I have written on my personal blog. The tutorial is available [here](http://links) and configures [grafana](https://grafana.com/), [loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) and [promtail](https://github.com/grafana/loki/tree/master/pkg/promtail) to centralise and visualise logs of a single application.
