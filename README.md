## Centralised-Logging and Visualisations

### Description

This repository has been created to host the code of a post that I have written on my personal blog. The tutorial is available [here](https://blog.mariossimou.dev/posts/600c1abe3de2c7001ef9eb1d) and configures [grafana](https://grafana.com/), [loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) and [promtail](https://github.com/grafana/loki/tree/master/pkg/promtail) to centralise and visualise logs of a single application.
